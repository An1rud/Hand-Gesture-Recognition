# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

## Description
This project includes Python scripts for accessing the camera, creating and collecting gesture data, training a dataset using LSTM, and live testing for gesture recognition.

## Files
### cam.py

Description: Used to access the camera and detect gesture points using MediaPipe.
### filecreating_collection.py

Description: Creates a file called MP_Data that stores live gesture points into a NumPy file.
### training.py

Description: Used to train the dataset created using LSTM and produce the model for gesture recognition.
### main.py

Description: Used for live testing of the trained gesture recognition model.
### mainv.py

Description: Used to test video files for gesture recognition.
## Usage
### Accessing the Camera (cam.py):

Instructions on how to use the script to access the camera and detect gesture points.
### Creating and Collecting Gesture Data (filecreating_collection.py):

Explanation on how to use the script to create and collect gesture data and store it in MP_Data.
### Training the Dataset (training.py):

Instructions on how to use the script to train the dataset using LSTM and generate the model.
### Live Testing (main.py):

Guidelines for live testing of gesture recognition using the trained model.
### Video File Testing (mainv.py):
